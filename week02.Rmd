```{r, include = TRUE}

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(bslib)
url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/master/full_data.csv'
gun_deaths <- read_csv(url)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
youth <- filter(gun_deaths, age <= 65)
```


``` {r, echo = FALSE}
glimpse(youth)
```


We have data about `r nrow(gun_deaths)` individuals killed by guns. Only `r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth) ` are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below: 

```{r youth-dist, echo = FALSE}

youth %>% 
ggplot(aes(age)) + 
geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1) 

```

```{r race-dist, echo = FALSE} 
youth %>% 
ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race) %>% fct_rev())) + 
geom_bar() + coord_flip() + 
labs(x = "Victim race") 
```
